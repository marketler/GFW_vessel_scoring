# About
This repository contains fishing scoring heuristics and evaluation of their effectiveness,
as well as development of supervised-ML scoring algorithms.

## Training data
Training data for this project is too big to store in this repository. It will be licensed separately here:
https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/training-data

You do not need the training data to use the predition models as the trained model parameters are stored in the repository.

## Tools
It also contains some tools to deal with the data formats of some of our partners:

* Kristinas CSV-based format
* Alex' and Chris' fishing-hour sidecar format

## API

    import vessel_scoring.models
    models = vessel_scoring.models.load_models()
    is_fishing = models['Logistic'].predict_proba(track_points)[:,1]
